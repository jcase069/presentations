# Pomodoro Time

## Frustration
Note: I was working at the same job for eleven years.  I was frustrated that
tasks took a long time.  I was interrupted often by people asking questions,
which made it difficult to improve.  The more intensely I tried to improve, the
worse the interruptions became.  So, I changed jobs.

## New Guy
Note: Learning a new job is difficult and time-consuming, and my new job in
drivers didn't seem to get any easier.  People were not interrupting me with
questions like they were before, but my timelines were still awful.  And no
matter how hard I tried, I felt like I wasn't getting anything done.  I started
questioning if I was any good at my job -- after all, in college I would have
been able to crank through this stuff.  But it seemed like I couldn't anymore.
And that felt awful.

## Bright Spot
Note: And then something pleasant happened: I had a good day, and at a time
when I wasn't expecting it.  The boss, seeing we were behind schedule, asked
the whole team to come in and work on a Saturday.  I got more done that day
than I had during the whole work week, and it felt great.  I didn't know what
my problem was at that point, but at least I knew the problem wasn't me -- I
could have a good, productive day.  Hopefully it wouldn't be only on Saturdays.
