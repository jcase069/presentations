Note:
So what is blockchain doing in healthcare?

In a word, hype.  There is a great deal of hype.  The Economist did a cover
story on Blockchain applications, and featured healthcare as a major target
for disruption.  There have been multiple summits specifically for healthcare
blockchain apps, including one here in Austin.  Google "blockchain healthcare"
and you get over 600K results.  The ONC -- the Department of Health and Human
Services' Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology --
issued a whitepaper challenge on blockchain in healthcare and got 70 submissions,
including the 15 winners which have now been published on their site.

There is a healthcare revolution brewing that will happen over the next
decade or so.

So, what is it?



## What is Blockchain?

Note: When you hear blockchain, you should think of Bitcoin: the world's first
successful distributed cryptocurrency.  Bitcoin was invented in 2009 by an
unknown person under the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto, and one of the innovations
it created was the blockchain.  The term "blockchain" can be used to describe
the Bitcoin implementation, or the  technology.  


## Bitcoin Network

Note:
The revolutionary idea of Bitcoin is how it can achieve a digital currency on
a completely distributed network of nodes.  Anyone can create a node on the
network -- they are all running open-source software.  And at first, that
doesn't seem safe.  After all, could I take the software and re-write it so
that all the bitcoin are transferred into my account?  Well, you can try but
you're going to fail.


## Distributed Network

Note:
The implementation of bitcoin is completely distributed.  At any moment, you
could have thousands of nodes on the network.  As of late 2016, there are
roughly 5000 listening nodes.  If a natural disaster took out most of the nodes,
the network would survive just fine.  There might be a hiccup, but there would
be no major disruption in service.  So the network, the storage, and the
computation work are all completely distributed.


## Centralized Ledger

Note:
All of the nodes on the network have a copy of all of the bitcoin transactions
covering the entire history of the currency.  As of November 2016, the size of
all transactions unindexed is approaching 90 gigabytes.  When new transactions
are proposed, all the nodes in the network can judge their validity, and as a
group the network will achieve consensus on which new transactions will be added
to the ledger.  It is this consensus mechanism that creates a conceptually
centralized ledger.

So when people say that Bitcoin is distributed, yes, the network is distributed.
But the genius is that the distributed network can create a conceptually
centralized ledger.

Note:
This is Mariana Catalina Izaguirre.  In 2009, the police came to evict her from
the house she was living in, at the request of the registered owner, who would
tear it down and rebuild.  Trouble was, Izaguirre, who had lived there for
thirty years, actually owned the land.  She had the deed to prove it.  The
Property Institute held fraudulent documentation filed by a criminal "owner".
Fortunately, Izaguirre had documentation -- an official title and deed to the
land -- so thankfully it was all straigtened out.  But only after she was
forcibly evicted while her children were at school, and her house was
demolished.

This story happened in Honduras, and it is not uncommon in developing countries.
In the U.S., we sometimes take for granted that our government doesn't
routinely give in to corruption and bribes.

So, what can the Blockchain do for Mariana?
